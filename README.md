> Ez oauth login package (with gorm)

## Example

There is an example of how to use the package in `examples/client`

To run the example, run the dummy oauth server with `go run examples/server/server.go`, and run the "client" with `go run examples/client/client.go`. The server will be available at http://localhost:8080, and you'll be able to log in with any username/password combination
